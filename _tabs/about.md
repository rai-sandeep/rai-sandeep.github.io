I am a **Software Engineer** at **Infosys** focusing on Java, Spring, DevOps, and the cloud.

I have worked in many different languages and platforms but currently that is primarily Java and GCP.

My non-computer passions are writing and travelling. Reach out to me (email address below) if you have any questions about these types of things, or just want to chat!
